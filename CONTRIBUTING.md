# Welcome-to-open-source Contributor Guide

## Steps to add yourself to the contributors' list.

1) You will first need git which you can download from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2) Now head [here](https://github.com/alisolanki/Welcome-to-Open-Source) and click on the `fork` button.

3) On the next page you will see a `create fork` button, press it.

4) You will land on your forked repo page, here you will see a `<> Code` button marked in green, click on it and copy the url.

5) Open your terminal and type git clone <url you copied> and press enter.

6) Now you will see a folder named `Welcome-to-Open-Source`, open it and edit the `README.md` file using any text editor, VScode for example.

7) Below is a code snippet for reference regarding what must be ADDED in the file. You must put your name inside the `<b> </b>` tag. You must place your GitHub profile URL in the `<a href=''></a>` tag. And lastly, you have to place your GitHub profile photo URL inside the `<img src="{GitHub profile photo URL here}"/>` tag.

    ```

8) Now save your changes and exit the editor, type `git add .`, afterward `git commit -m "<your name> üçâ"` and lastly `git push origin master`.

9) Go to your forked repo page, `sync` your fork, and then there you will see a button in green that says `Open pull request`, press it and in the comments section type "Adding my name to contributor list" and press on `create pull request`.

10) You have created a pull request, wait for a member to review and merge it : )
